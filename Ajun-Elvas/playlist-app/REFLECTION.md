# Reflection

## Challenges

- Managing clean architecture in a small project
- Implementing simple auth without JWT
- Mapping foreign key relations with plain SQL

## Lessons Learned

- Understanding routing, middleware, and modular code
- Using Go standard libraries for database operations
- Structuring project cleanly from the beginning

## Design Decision

I chose to use `gin-gonic` for its simplicity and focus on performance.
